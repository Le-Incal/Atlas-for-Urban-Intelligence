# SECTION 5: PROMPT FOR CLAUDE

Use the following prompt when asking Claude to update the Atlas with this expanded ontology:

---

## PROMPT: Update Atlas for Urban Intelligence Data Files

```
I need you to update the data files for the Atlas for Urban Intelligence project. 

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:**
- DO NOT modify any UI components, styling, or animations
- DO NOT change GraphCanvas.jsx, LegendPanel.jsx, NodeDetailPanel.jsx, or AtlasScene.jsx
- DO NOT alter the force-directed layout algorithm or interaction handlers
- ONLY update the data files: src/data/nodes.json and src/data/edges.json

**THE TASK:**
Replace the existing 55 nodes and 72 edges with the expanded ontology containing:
- 211 nodes
- 387 edges

**DATA SOURCE:**
Use the EXPANDED_ONTOLOGY.md document (attached or in project files) as the authoritative source.

**NODE JSON SCHEMA:**
Each node must follow this exact structure:
{
  "id": "l0-001",
  "label": "Bedrock",
  "layer": 0,
  "layerName": "Bio-Physical Foundation",
  "color": "#2E2F2C",
  "nodeType": "Geological",
  "clusters": ["structural-L0", "metabolic-flow"],
  "description": "The lithospheric substrate upon which all urban form rests..."
}

**EDGE JSON SCHEMA:**
Each edge must follow this exact structure:
{
  "id": "e-E-001",
  "source": "l0-020",
  "target": "l2-001",
  "edgeType": "E",
  "edgeTypeName": "Energy",
  "isPrimary": true,
  "direction": "L0 → L2",
  "description": "Energy Grid powers Technical Infrastructure"
}

**LAYER COLORS (unchanged):**
- L0: #2E2F2C (Deep Slate)
- L1: #4A5A63 (Blue-Gray)
- L2: #4F7A74 (Desaturated Teal)
- L3: #5A5F8C (Muted Indigo)
- L4: #7A6A9E (Soft Amethyst)
- L5: #9B6A5F (Burnt Umber)
- L6: #B89A5A (Warm Brass)

**LAYER NAMES:**
- 0: "Bio-Physical Foundation"
- 1: "Observable Reality"
- 2: "Cyber-Physical"
- 3: "Logic/Knowledge"
- 4: "Agentic Intelligence"
- 5: "Socio-Economic"
- 6: "Governance"

**EDGE TYPE NAMES:**
- E: "Energy"
- M: "Memory"
- D: "Data"
- C: "Constraint"
- I: "Intent"
- V: "Validation"
- R: "Reasoning"

**CLUSTER ASSIGNMENTS:**
Assign each node to appropriate clusters:
- Structural clusters: "structural-L0" through "structural-L6"
- Thematic clusters: "risk-resilience", "capital-value", "synthetic-labor", "metabolic-flow"

**VALIDATION:**
After generating the files:
1. Verify all source/target IDs in edges exist in nodes
2. Confirm node count = 211
3. Confirm edge count = 387
4. Ensure no duplicate IDs

**OUTPUT:**
Provide the complete nodes.json and edges.json files ready to replace the existing files.
```
